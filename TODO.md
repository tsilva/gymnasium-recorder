# TODO

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Agent recording / programmatic API (record RL agent rollouts, not just human keyboard input)
- [ ] Dataset metadata for reproducibility (action/observation space, env kwargs, library versions)
- [ ] Epis2ode statistics and filtering (`stats` command, drop short episodes, action distributions)

## Low Priority

- [ ] Export to Minari / D4RL format for offline RL library compatibility
