üé¨ Record [Gymnasium ALE](https://ale.farama.org/environments/) gameplays as Hugging Face datasets with ease

## üìñ Overview

gymnasium-recorder is a tool that wraps [Gymnasium ALE environments](https://ale.farama.org/environments/) (specifically Atari games) to record gameplay sessions as datasets. It captures frames and actions during interactive play, saving them as structured datasets that can be uploaded to Hugging Face Hub.

The tool provides a pygame interface for playing Atari games while recording your actions, making it easy to create training datasets for reinforcement learning models. It also supports replaying recorded sessions to verify environment determinism.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gymnasium-recorder.git
cd gymnasium-recorder

# Create and activate the conda environment
source activate-env.sh

# Create a .env file with your Hugging Face token
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your token
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Recording a gameplay session

```bash
python main.py record BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
```

This will open a pygame window where you can play Breakout. Use the following controls:
- Space: Action 1
- Right Arrow: Action 2
- Left Arrow: Action 3

The session will be automatically saved as a dataset and uploaded to Hugging Face Hub if you've provided a token.

### Replaying a recorded session

```bash
python main.py playback BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
```

This will replay a previously recorded session from Hugging Face Hub, allowing you to verify the environment's deterministic behavior.

### Customizing Key Mappings

For VizDoom environments, you can customize the key mappings using the `set_vizdoom_keymap` method:

```python
env = create_env("VizdoomBasic-v0")
recorder = DatasetRecorderWrapper(env)

# Customize key mappings
custom_keymap = {
    pygame.K_a: 0,     # MOVE_LEFT
    pygame.K_d: 1,     # MOVE_RIGHT
    pygame.K_SPACE: 3  # ATTACK
}
recorder.set_vizdoom_keymap(custom_keymap)

# Start recording with custom keys
await recorder.record(fps=30)
```

Default VizDoom key mappings:
- Space Bar: ATTACK (action 3)
- Left Arrow: MOVE_LEFT (action 0)
- Right Arrow: ATTACK (action 3)
- Up Arrow: MOVE_RIGHT (action 1)
- Down Arrow: MOVE_LEFT (action 0)
- Z, X, C: Alternative movement keys
